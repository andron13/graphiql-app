# ⚛️ GraphiQL-App: REST/GraphQL Client

🦥 RS-School React Final Task.

## Overview

This repository hosts the development of a lightweight application combining features of Postman and GraphiQL. The application allows users to interact with RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints, offering method selection, URL input, headers editing, and response viewing.

## Purpose

The goal is to create a tool that supports both REST and GraphQL requests, integrating authentication, history tracking, and a user-friendly interface. The app is built using React 18+ with NextJS or Remix, ensuring a modern, efficient, and accessible development environment.

## Key Features

- RESTful API client with method selection and headers editor.
- GraphiQL client with query editor and documentation explorer.
- User authentication via Firebase.
- Request history with easy retrieval and re-execution.
- Internationalization support.

**\*GraphiQL:** Your interactive GraphQL and RESTful API IDE, empowering website development with syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and dynamic documentation 🤩.\*
